/**
 * Product Showcase - Theming System
 * 
 * ARCHITECTURE CHOICE:
 * Choose either CUBE CSS or BEM for organizing your CSS.
 * Document your choice and follow it consistently throughout.
 * 
 * CUBE CSS approach:
 * - Composition: Layout patterns (.flow, .grid, .cluster)
 * - Utilities: Single-purpose classes (.text-center, .font-bold)
 * - Blocks: Component styles (.card, .button)
 * - Exceptions: State variations (add additional classes as needed)
 * 
 * BEM approach:
 * - Blocks: Standalone components (.card)
 * - Elements: Parts of blocks (.card__title, .card__image)
 * - Modifiers: Variations (.card--featured)
 * 
 * ORGANIZATION:
 * You may create additional CSS files if you prefer to separate:
 * - Base styles and custom properties
 * - Layout patterns
 * - Components
 * - Utilities
 * 
 * MODERN CSS FEATURES TO USE:
 * - CSS nesting throughout
 * - Custom properties for theming
 * - color-mix() for color variations
 * - Modern selectors (:is, :where, :has, :not)
 * - Logical properties (margin-inline, padding-block)
 * 
 * REQUIREMENTS:
 * 1. Define theme system with custom properties
 * 2. Implement light and dark themes
 * 3. Support prefers-color-scheme
 * 4. Use color-mix() for color variations
 * 5. Create responsive layout
 * 6. Ensure accessibility (contrast, focus indicators, reduced motion)
 * 7. Style all components and states
